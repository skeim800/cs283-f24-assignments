# Hungry Hungry Froggie

I made a very simple game called "Hungry Hungry Froggie." Essentially, the player is the frog which can move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys. There are hamburgers that randomly generate on game start and move back and forth across the screen. The goal is for Froggie to eat all the burgers. He should size up some as he eats and once he's eaten all the burgers, the game's over. You'll know because there's a message saying, "He's all full!"
