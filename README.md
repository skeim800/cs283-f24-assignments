### Final Game

To play Rat-Turn of the Villagers! you need to know the following controls:
- W, A, D to move forward and turn
- scroll mouse up and down for looking up and down
- R to launch dynamite
- F to launch potatoes

The goal is to turn all the rats back to villagers by colliding with them and also to defeat the evil wizard by hitting him with potatoes! You lose if you run out of health which will go down if the wizard hits you with crystal balls so watch out!

The game lives in the Project scene.
